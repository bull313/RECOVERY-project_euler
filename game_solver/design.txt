            * Procedure
                * Receive a dict as input
                * Define Conversion(Current Game Node = Initial dict, This Game):
                    * Initialize this node (unknown type)
                    * Iterate over each key-value pair in Current Game Node:
                        * Check key name:
                            * Player
                                * This node type is decision
                                * This node's player is this value
                            * Info State
                                * This node type is decision
                                * Add this info state string to This Game's info state list
                                * This node's info state is this info state's index in that list
                            * Action Names
                                * This node type is decision
                                * This nodes action names are this list
                            * Utility
                                * This node type is terminal
                                * This node's utility is this list
                            * Children
                                * If this node type is not resolved
                                    * This node type is nature
                                * Initialize this node's child list
                                * For each dict in this list:
                                    * Child Node is Conversion(dict)
                                    * This node's child list includes Child Node
